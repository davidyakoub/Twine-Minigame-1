# Twine-Minigame-1

## Devlog

I found the tutorials somewhat difficult to get through. The assignment itself wasn't difficult, it was just following the tutorials and submitting it that was a little difficult.



I had a medium-effort time, my main problem wasn't something that I think I could've just gotten help with, but I eventually got around it.
